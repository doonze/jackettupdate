JackettUpdate 2.0 Very Beta
* Broke the main script into pieces. This is so that at least a self update will now impact the updating of jackett
* Changed custom functions naming convention to be uniform throughout the script
* Created configread.py and mainupdate.py while breaking up the main jackettupdate.py script
* Became very frustrated with Python and the way it handles passing variables between modules
* To Do: Still need to figure out how to update everything on a first run. v2.0 is a first step.
* Moved all the modules into their own folder and out of the main directory to make things cleaner

JackettUpdate 1.5 Beta (Rolled 5/24 2020)
* Created getfile for downloading files, display_time to give human readable in customfunctions
* Moved timestamp function into customfunctions and you can now give it a sting to output as well
* Added app variable for use in timestamp to each updater
* Removed subprocess call to wget and now using request.get through getfile function to download files
* Removed tar subprocess and now using pythons tarfile to extract tars, function tar_extract added to customfunctions
* Function tar_extract now being used in jackettupdate
* Function remove_file added to customfunctions, python is now removing the tar file instead of subprocess

* Changed the formatting of timestamps to look cleaner
* Wrote step by step comments in my functions for customfunctions

JackettUpdate 1.4 Beta
